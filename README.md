Pick Largest Number

Description

Simulation of the open problem presented in the book "Open Problems in Communication and Computation".

Player 1 writes down any two distinct numbers on separate slips of paper. Player 2 randomly chooses one of these slips of paper and looks at the number. Player 2 must decide whether the number in his hand is the larger of the two numbers. He can be right with probability one-half. It seems absurd that he can do better.

As wierd as it is, the proposed method (referred to as 'advanced strategy' in the sumulation) just works. To me, it looks like entanglment effect in pure math world.
I wonder how it could be used ;)
